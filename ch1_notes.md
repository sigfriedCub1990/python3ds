## General notes

- Classes are used to implement Abstract Data Types (ADT)

## Discussion questions
1. Construct a class hierarchy for people on a college campus. Include faculty, staff, and students. What do they have in common? What distinguishes them from one another?
2. Construct a class hierarchy for bank accounts.
3. Construct a class hierarchy for different types of computers.
4. Using the classes provided in the chapter, interactively construct a circuit and test it.
